title: AI Chat
description: Chat with your memory using built-in AI powered by OpenCode.
---

Supacortex includes a built-in AI chat that lets you talk to your saved content. Ask questions, find things, brainstorm — all powered by [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai).

## How it works

The chat has access to your entire memory — bookmarks, conversations, and identity. When you ask a question, it searches your saved content and uses it as context to give you relevant answers.

## Using chat in the Mac app

Open the chat panel in the Mac app sidebar. You can:

- Ask questions about your bookmarks ("What did Karpathy say about fine-tuning?")
- Find specific content ("Show me tweets about indie hacking")
- Brainstorm with context from your saved content
- Reference specific bookmarks in the conversation

## Privacy

AI chat conversations are stored locally on your device by default. Nothing is sent to the cloud unless you explicitly choose to save a conversation to your memory.

This means:

- Your chat history stays on your Mac
- You can chat freely without worrying about data leaving your device
- Only conversations you save with `scx conversation add` are stored in the cloud and accessible from other devices

## Requirements

AI chat is currently available in the Mac desktop app only. The web interface shows read-only conversation history.
