title: Authentication
description: Set up authentication for the Mac app, CLI, and API.

Supacortex uses different auth methods depending on how you access it.

## Mac app & web

Sign in with your email and password at [supacortex.ai](https://supacortex.ai). The Mac app uses the same account — just sign in when you first open it.

## CLI

The CLI uses a device code flow:

```bash
scx login
```

This opens your browser where you approve the device. Once approved, the CLI stores your credentials locally and you're ready to go.

To check who you're logged in as:

```bash
scx whoami
```

To log out:

```bash
scx logout
```

## API keys

For programmatic access (scripts, integrations, CI/CD), use API keys instead of session auth.

### Create an API key

You can create API keys from the Mac app settings or via the CLI:

```bash
scx token create
```

### Use an API key

Pass the key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://api.supacortex.ai/v1/bookmarks
```

### Manage tokens

List your API keys:

```bash
scx token list
```

Revoke a key:

```bash
scx token revoke <key-id>
```
