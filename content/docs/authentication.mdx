title: Authentication
description: Set up authentication for the Mac app, CLI, and API.

## Mac app & web

Sign in with your email and password at [supacortex.ai](https://supacortex.ai). The Mac app uses the same account.

## CLI

The CLI uses a device code flow:

```bash
scx login
```

This opens your browser where you approve the device. Once approved, the CLI stores your credentials locally.

To check your current session:

```bash
scx whoami
```

To log out:

```bash
scx logout
```

## API keys

For programmatic access (scripts, integrations, CI/CD), use API keys instead of session auth.

### Create an API key

In the Mac app, click your avatar → **API key** → type a name → **Create**.

### Use an API key

Pass the key as a Bearer token:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://api.supacortex.ai/v1/bookmarks
```

You can also set it directly in the CLI instead of using the browser login:

```bash
scx token <your-api-key>
```
