title: Introduction
description: One memory for all your AI. Save your bookmarks, notes, and conversations in one place — use them across every AI tool.
---

Supacortex is a personal memory layer for your AI tools. You save content — bookmarks, links, conversations — and access it from anywhere: the Mac app, the CLI, Claude Code, OpenClaw, or any tool that supports skills.

## The problem

Memory is fragmented across AI tools. You brainstorm in Claude, research in ChatGPT, code in Claude Code — each app has its own memory silo. When you switch tools or a new one drops, you start from zero.

## How Supacortex solves it

Save things once, use them everywhere:

- **Capture** — Sync your Twitter/X bookmarks, save links, store conversations
- **Search** — Full-text search across everything you've saved
- **Chat** — Talk to your memory with built-in AI chat powered by OpenCode
- **Access** — Pull your memory into any AI tool via CLI or skills

## Quick start

### Mac app (recommended)

Download the app and everything is set up for you — CLI, skills, and AI chat included.

1. [Download the Mac app](https://supacortex.ai)
2. Sign up and log in
3. Start saving and chatting

### CLI

Install the CLI and skill to access your memory from any terminal:
