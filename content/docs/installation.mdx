description: Install Supacortex via the Mac app or CLI.
---

There are two ways to use Supacortex. The Mac app gives you the full experience with zero setup. The CLI takes your memory everywhere.

## Mac app

Download the latest version from [supacortex.ai](https://supacortex.ai). The installer sets up everything for you — the CLI, skills, and AI chat are all included.

1. Download and install the app
2. Sign up and log in
3. Start saving bookmarks and chatting with your memory

## CLI

Install the CLI globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g @supacortex/cli
```

The binary is called `scx`. Verify the installation:

```bash
scx --version
```

### Install the Supacortex skill

To access your memory from AI tools like Claude Code, install the skill:

```bash
npx skills add monorepo-labs/skills --skill supacortex
```

### Log in

Authenticate with your Supacortex account:

```bash
scx login
```

This opens a browser window where you approve the device. Once approved, the CLI is ready to use.
