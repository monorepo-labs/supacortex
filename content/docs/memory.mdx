description: How Supacortex stores and organizes your memory.
---

Supacortex isn't just a bookmark manager — it's a memory layer. Everything you save becomes structured, searchable memory that your AI tools can access.

## Memory types

### Bookmarks

Content you've saved — tweets, links, articles.

- Synced from Twitter/X automatically
- Saved manually via CLI or Mac app
- Full-text indexed for search
- Organized into groups

### Conversations

Summaries of your AI conversations. Stored in three tiers:

- **Brief** — A single sentence capturing the key takeaway
- **Summary** — Bullet points of the main topics and decisions
- **Detailed** — Full context and reasoning

Save a conversation via CLI:

```bash
scx conversation add "Decided to use Fumadocs for documentation" --tier brief
```

```bash
scx conversation add "Full discussion about architecture" --tier detailed --title "Architecture decision"
```

### Identity

Metadata about you — goals, preferences, interests. This helps AI tools understand your context.

Categories: **core**, **goals**, **preferences**, **interests**

```bash
scx identity add "Ship Supacortex v1 by March" --category goals
```

## Accessing memory

Your memory is accessible from:

- **Mac app** — Browse, search, and chat with your memory
- **CLI** — `scx bookmarks`, `scx conversation`, `scx identity` commands
- **API** — REST endpoints for programmatic access
- **AI tools** — Via the Supacortex skill installed in Claude Code or other tools
