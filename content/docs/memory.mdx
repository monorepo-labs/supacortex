description: How Supacortex stores and organizes your memory.
---

Supacortex isn't just a bookmark manager — it's a memory layer. Everything you save becomes structured, searchable memory that your AI tools can access.

## Memory types

### Bookmarks

Content you've saved — tweets, links, articles. These are the foundation of your memory.

- Synced from Twitter/X automatically
- Saved manually via CLI or Mac app
- Full-text indexed for search
- Organized into groups

### Conversations

Summaries of your AI conversations that you want to remember. Stored in three tiers:

- **Brief** — A single sentence capturing the key takeaway
- **Summary** — Bullet points of the main topics and decisions
- **Detailed** — Full context and reasoning

Save a conversation:

```bash
scx conversation add --brief "Decided to use Fumadocs for documentation"
```

List conversations:

```bash
scx conversation list
```

### Identity

Metadata about you — your goals, preferences, and interests. This helps AI tools understand your context.

Categories:
- **Core** — Who you are, what you do
- **Goals** — What you're working toward
- **Preferences** — How you like things done
- **Interests** — Topics you care about

Set identity info:

```bash
scx identity set --category goals --value "Ship Supacortex v1 by March"
```

## Accessing memory

Your memory is accessible from:

- **Mac app** — Browse, search, and chat with your memory
- **CLI** — `scx bookmarks`, `scx conversation`, `scx identity` commands
- **API** — REST endpoints for programmatic access
- **AI tools** — Via the Supacortex skill installed in Claude Code, OpenClaw, etc.
