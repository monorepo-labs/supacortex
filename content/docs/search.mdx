Supacortex indexes everything you save for instant full-text search. Find any bookmark, note, or conversation in milliseconds.

## How it works

Every piece of content is indexed using PostgreSQL full-text search vectors. When you save a bookmark or conversation, it's automatically indexed on the title, content, author, and URL.

## Search in the Mac app

Use the search bar at the top of the library to search across all your bookmarks. Results update as you type.

## Search via CLI

```bash
scx bookmarks list --search "react server components"
```

This searches across all bookmark fields — title, content, author, and URL.

## Search via API

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.supacortex.ai/v1/bookmarks?search=react+server+components"
```

## What's indexed

- Bookmark title
- Bookmark content / tweet text
- Author name and handle
- URL
- Conversation content (all tiers)
