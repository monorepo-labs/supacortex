description: Sync your Twitter/X bookmarks into Supacortex.
---

Supacortex imports your Twitter/X bookmarks — full content extraction, author info, and media. Once synced, everything is searchable and accessible from your AI tools.

## Connect your X account

Twitter sync is available in the Mac app only.

1. Open the Mac app
2. Click **Connect X** in the sidebar
3. Authorize via OAuth

## Sync your bookmarks

After connecting, click the **Sync** button in the sidebar and follow the steps. The first sync imports all your bookmarks — subsequent syncs only pick up new ones.

## Sync via CLI

You can also trigger a sync from the terminal:

```bash
scx sync twitter
```

To only sync bookmarks from a specific year onwards:

```bash
scx sync twitter --since 2024
```

Check the latest sync status:

```bash
scx sync status
```

## How it works

- **Initial sync** imports all your bookmarks (can take a few minutes depending on volume)
- **Incremental sync** picks up new bookmarks since the last sync
- **Rate limits** are handled automatically — if the X API rate-limits the request, the sync pauses and resumes where it left off

## What gets saved

For each bookmark, Supacortex stores:

- Tweet content (full text)
- Author name and handle
- Media URLs (images, videos)
- Original tweet URL
- When the tweet was created
