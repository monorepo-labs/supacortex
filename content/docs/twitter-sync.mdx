title: Twitter/X Sync
description: Sync your Twitter/X bookmarks into Supacortex.
---

Supacortex can import all your Twitter/X bookmarks — full content extraction, author info, and media. Once synced, everything is searchable and accessible from any of your AI tools.

## Connect your X account

1. Open the Mac app or go to [supacortex.ai](https://supacortex.ai)
2. Go to Settings and connect your X account via OAuth
3. Your bookmarks will start syncing automatically

## Sync via CLI

You can also trigger a sync from the terminal:

```bash
scx sync twitter
```

### Sync from a specific year

To only sync bookmarks from a certain year onwards:

```bash
scx sync twitter --since 2024
```

### Check sync status

```bash
scx sync status
```

## How it works

- **Initial sync** imports all your bookmarks (this can take a few minutes depending on how many you have)
- **Incremental sync** picks up new bookmarks since the last sync
- **Rate limits** are handled automatically — if the X API rate-limits the request, the sync pauses and resumes where it left off
- **Content extraction** pulls the full tweet text, author handle, author name, media URLs, and creation date

## What gets saved

For each bookmark, Supacortex stores:

- Tweet content (full text)
- Author name and handle
- Media URLs (images, videos)
- Original tweet URL
- When the tweet was created
- Full-text search index for instant search
